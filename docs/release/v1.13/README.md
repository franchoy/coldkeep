# v1.13 - Engine Stabilization Baseline & Contract Inventory

## Purpose

v1.13 starts after v1.12.3 completion. Its purpose is to stabilize the engine contract surface,
stabilize the catalog contract surface, harden dependency direction, clarify engine-level
correctness invariant ownership, prepare for SQLite-first local portability, and preserve
PostgreSQL compatibility while the project moves toward future v2.x local-first productization.

v1.13.0 is the baseline release for that work. It is documentation and inventory only, and it
must not change runtime behavior.

## v1.13 Goals

- Engine contract stabilization.
- Catalog contract stabilization.
- Dependency-direction hardening.
- Engine-level invariant ownership clarification.
- SQLite-first local portability preparation.
- PostgreSQL compatibility preservation.

## v1.13.0 Baseline Policy

- v1.13.0 is baseline and inventory only.
- v1.13.0 must not change runtime behavior.
- v1.13.0 does not implement v2.x work.
- v1.13.0 prepares the project for v2.x local-first productization without implementing daemon,
  API, UI, protocol, or product-surface changes.

## Release Boundaries

Do not change during v1.13.0:

- Go code.
- Tests.
- Schema or migrations.
- CLI behavior.
- JSON output.
- Exit codes.
- Storage format.
- Repository format.
- Default backend behavior.
- Engine routing.
- Catalog implementation.
- CI behavior.
- Scripts.

Do not implement during v1.13.0:

- New engine operations.
- New catalog methods.
- SQLite default switch.
- PostgreSQL removal.
- Daemon, API, UI, or v2 work.
- Broad refactors.

## Release Artifacts

The v1.13.0 baseline is defined by:

- `docs/release/v1.13/v1.13.0-scope.md`
- `docs/release/v1.13/v1.13.0-phase-list.md`
- `docs/release/v1.13/v1.13.0-validation-checklist.md`

All v1.13.0 phases stay on `release/v1.13.0` until the full release gate is green.

## Current Release State

- `v1.13.9` is complete, merged, tagged, published, and operationally closed.
- Phase 24 is complete; PR #104 merged, `v1.13.9` was tagged and released,
  and release/tag CI passed.
- `release/v1.13.9` was deleted locally and remotely. No Phase 25 was
  required, and no mandatory v1.x runtime remediation remained.
- `v1.13.10 — v1.x Closure Integrity and CI Runtime Hygiene` is released and
  operationally closed. It is a valid closure-integrity and CI-runtime-hygiene
  baseline, not the final v1.x release.
- A post-release roadmap-to-code audit superseded the narrower final-v1.x
  conclusion and restored v1.13.11–v1.13.13 for remaining must-before-v2 work.
- `v1.13.11 — Safety and Backend Compatibility Gate Closure` is the single
  active release. Phases 0–2 are complete; Phase 3 — Reusable Dual-Backend Test Harness is Next. Phase 2 classified existing backend evidence only; no parity implementation has started. Its canonical trackers are
  `v1.13.11-phase0-post-release-closure-correction-and-baseline.md`,
  `v1.13.11-scope.md`, `v1.13.11-phase-list.md`,
  `v1.13.11-validation-checklist.md`, and `v1.13.11-release-gate.md`.
- The updated `v1.13.x-release-train.md` is the authoritative current plan;
  final v1.x completion is gated by v1.13.11–v1.13.13. v2.0 implementation has
  not started.
- `v1.13.10-engine-contract-documentation-truthfulness.md` records the current
  Engine contract boundary and its intentional limitations.
- `v1.13.10-release-state-validator-contract.md` freezes the lifecycle,
  evidence, parsing, CKRS rule, output, fixture, and CI integration contract.
- `v1.13.10-release-state-validator-implementation.md` records its
  deterministic implementation, isolated tests, and blocking CI enforcement.
- `v1.13.10-github-actions-node24-artifact-migration.md` records the five-step
  upload-artifact v7 migration and semantic-preservation evidence.
- `v1.13.10-v1x-closure-summary-and-v2.0-handoff-freeze.md` freezes the final
  v1.x baseline, explicit v2.0 inputs, and v2/v3 scope boundary.
- v1.13.10's public release, tag, merge, tag-CI, and deleted-release-branch
  evidence is recorded separately from its historical pre-release gate narrative.
