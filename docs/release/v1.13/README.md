# v1.13 - Engine Stabilization Baseline & Contract Inventory

## Purpose

v1.13 starts after v1.12.3 completion. Its purpose is to stabilize the engine contract surface,
stabilize the catalog contract surface, harden dependency direction, clarify engine-level
correctness invariant ownership, prepare for SQLite-first local portability, and preserve
PostgreSQL compatibility while the project moves toward future v2.x local-first productization.

v1.13.0 is the baseline release for that work. It is documentation and inventory only, and it
must not change runtime behavior.

## v1.13 Goals

- Engine contract stabilization.
- Catalog contract stabilization.
- Dependency-direction hardening.
- Engine-level invariant ownership clarification.
- SQLite-first local portability preparation.
- PostgreSQL compatibility preservation.

## v1.13.0 Baseline Policy

- v1.13.0 is baseline and inventory only.
- v1.13.0 must not change runtime behavior.
- v1.13.0 does not implement v2.x work.
- v1.13.0 prepares the project for v2.x local-first productization without implementing daemon,
  API, UI, protocol, or product-surface changes.

## Release Boundaries

Do not change during v1.13.0:

- Go code.
- Tests.
- Schema or migrations.
- CLI behavior.
- JSON output.
- Exit codes.
- Storage format.
- Repository format.
- Default backend behavior.
- Engine routing.
- Catalog implementation.
- CI behavior.
- Scripts.

Do not implement during v1.13.0:

- New engine operations.
- New catalog methods.
- SQLite default switch.
- PostgreSQL removal.
- Daemon, API, UI, or v2 work.
- Broad refactors.

## Release Artifacts

The v1.13.0 baseline is defined by:

- `docs/release/v1.13/v1.13.0-scope.md`
- `docs/release/v1.13/v1.13.0-phase-list.md`
- `docs/release/v1.13/v1.13.0-validation-checklist.md`

All v1.13.0 phases stay on `release/v1.13.0` until the full release gate is green.

## Current Release State

- `v1.13.8` is released.
- `v1.13.9` is active on `release/v1.13.9`.
- `v1.13.9` Phase 0 is complete.
- `v1.13.9` executable Phase 0 baseline is
  `c3a5a537d9dfad197f35c258ab78a75526bad788`.
- `v1.13.9` Phase 1 is authorized and next.
